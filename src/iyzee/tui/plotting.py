"""Draw a set of labeled (x, y) series into a ``PlotextPlot`` widget.

The single source of truth for the "clear, plot each series, set
title/labels, refresh" boilerplate that used to be written out
independently in ``SweepScreen._plot_result``, ``TracesScreen._show``,
and ``IyzeeConsole._draw_figure`` — those three differ in where their
series data comes from (a live sweep, a saved ``.npz``, a matplotlib
``Figure``'s line data), not in how it ends up on screen.

Pairs with ``experiment.io.difference_series``, which is the equivalent
consolidation for the squeezing-minus-shot-noise *computation* — that one
lives in ``experiment/`` since it's plotting-backend-agnostic (matplotlib
and this module both build on it); this one is plotext/Textual-specific
and belongs with the rest of the TUI instead.
